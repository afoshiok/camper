An open-source canvassing platform. Submission for HouHack 2025.

# Intro
One of the most effective ways to reach people for campaigns is to approach them door-to-door. However, there aren't many options to keep track of canvassing efforts, and the ones that do exist can be unaffordable for campaigns with tighter budgets. Camper offers all you need to track your canvassing progress.
